Automated Image Processing

This script automates the process of image processing using the Python Imaging Library (PIL). It opens an input image, performs processing operations (e.g., converting to grayscale), and saves the processed image.

Instructions:

Ensure you have PIL installed (pip install pillow).
Replace input_image.jpg with your input image file name.
Run the script.
